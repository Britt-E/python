# Brittany Evans - Weather Project

## Project Description
Everyday we collect data about the weather in order to predict the forecast for the coming days. The problem is that this data is never in a human readable format, thatâ€™s where you come in! Your task is to process csv files containing data about the weather, and convert them into meaningful text-based summaries.

## Project TESTS
- [x] def format_temperature(temp):
- [x] def convert_date(iso_string):
- [x] def convert_f_to_c(temp_in_farenheit):
- [x] def calculate_mean(weather_data):
- [x] def load_data_from_csv(csv_file):
- [x] def find_min(weather_data):
- [x] def find_max(weather_data):
- [x] def generate_summary(weather_data):
- [x] generate_daily_summary(weather_data):

## TESTS PASSED
- [x] Implement the methods in `weather.py`.
- [x] Verify that everything works as intended by running the tests with `python run_tests.py`.
- [x] ALL weather data tests passed
